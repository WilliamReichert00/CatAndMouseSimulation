# CatAndMouseSimulation
a completely reworked version of the cat and mouse neural network based simulation, using pygame.
Hello and thank you for taking a look at this project.
The program was coded in Python 3.9 using Pycharm ide (v2020.3.5).
The program uses Pygame, math, time, numpy, and random modules. Make sure they are installed before running the simulation.
Various Parameters can be changed in the game.py file, such as the window size and the number of entities in the simulation.
